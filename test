Azure Databricks Delta Sharing
 Roles and Responsibilities and Shared Responsibility Model
 Unity Catalog based Delta Sharing
Objective
 This document defines clear ownership for all activities required to enable, govern, and operate Delta Sharing using Unity Catalog in Azure Databricks. It establishes which team is responsible for account level configuration, metastore governance, security and compliance controls, network readiness, share and recipient administration, automation ownership, and ongoing operational support. The document is written from the Azure perspective only.
Scope
 This applies to Delta Sharing implementations where Unity Catalog is used to publish shares from provider teams and allow recipient workspaces to consume shared tables or views through a catalog created from the share. The operating model assumes L1 scripts are the standard mechanism for executing repeatable Delta Sharing operations. Azure Platform Engineering owns the L1 framework and scripts. Application teams run approved L1 scripts for share and asset operations. Data Platform executes metastore governed operations such as recipient creation and share recipient attachment using L1 scripts.

Shared responsibility model overview
 Delta Sharing in Azure requires shared ownership across teams. Account and metastore administrators provide the platform and governance foundations. Azure Platform Engineering builds and maintains the L1 automation framework. Data Platform operates the metastore governed steps through L1 scripts. Application teams own the data product and execute approved L1 scripts to create shares and attach assets. Network and Security teams provide connectivity and policy oversight where required.
Operating rules and governance statements
 Azure Platform Engineering owns and maintains the L1 scripts and automation framework used for Delta Sharing operations.
 Application teams are permitted to execute approved L1 scripts to create shares and attach assets to shares, using approved service principals.
 Data Platform team is responsible for recipient creation and recipient to share attachment using L1 scripts, since these are metastore governed actions.
 Recipient creation is a metastore governance activity and is treated as a one time operation per recipient workspace or identity per metastore.
 Recipient objects must be reused and duplicate recipient creation is not permitted.
 Metastore level privileged grants are owned and controlled by the Metastore Admin.
 Account level enablement and account wide settings are owned and controlled by the Databricks Account Admin.
 Catalog creation from an incoming share on the recipient side is a privileged operation and is performed by Data Platform or Metastore Admin using approved service principals and L1 scripts.
 All actions must be auditable and aligned to approved access requests.
Responsibility areas and ownership
 This section is the core of the document and should be used as the primary reference.
Databricks Account Admin responsibilities

 Own the dataset being shared including correctness, quality, and expected schema behavior.
 Obtain business and compliance approvals required to share data.
 Define what tables or views are shared and ensure the share contents align to approved scope.
 Create shares and attach approved assets using the approved L1 scripts provided by Azure Platform Engineering.
Raise a firewall request to the network team if its not opened prior.

6. Network team responsibilities
 Validate and implement network connectivity requirements required for Delta Sharing flows as per approved architecture of the app team.
 Open required network paths and confirm reachability based on security approvals of  the app team.
 Provide validation evidence that connectivity is in place and stable between both the provider and recipient workspaces.
 Support incident troubleshooting when connectivity restrictions or routing issues impact sharing.


7. Application team Recipient side responsibilities
 Obtain approvals required to consume shared data in Azure.
 Consume the shared data through the approved catalog and access model.
 Request access for users or service principals through approved channels.
